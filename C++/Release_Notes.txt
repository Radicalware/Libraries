                   !!! Release Highlights !!!

---------------------------------------------------------------------

10/30/2019 >> Libs v12.2.0

Nexus was greatly slowed down due to Base class not being a pod.
It's speed has been almost doubled to my suprise. xvector
now has new functionality and a much different configuration with 
two new base-classes and minimal increase in code due to no
repeating constructors. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

10/25/2019 >> Libs v12.1.0

Timer.h was added.
Lots of multi-threading integration has been made for xvector/xmap
using Nexus.h

---------------------------------------------------------------------

10/9/2019 >> Libs v11.0.3

Nexus had a memory leak that was removed

---------------------------------------------------------------------

10/9/2019 >> Libs v11.0.2

Sense Release Nexus is pretty well established.
exception handling, recalling values, 
cross-instance thread limiter, cross-platform, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

10/8/2019 >> Libs v11.0.1

Nexus is still in beta.
It is working decently well in windows but is broken in Linux.
It will be updated soon.
