10/16/2019 >> Libs v12.0.0

Threader.h has been added. This is basically Nexus but without
xvector/xstring/xmap. I will be using it in those objects
to make integrated multi-threading in later releases. Nexus will
get all the new updates because it is easier to work with.

10/9/2019 >> Libs v11.0.3

Nexus had a memory leak that was removed

10/9/2019 >> Libs v11.0.2

Sense Release Nexus is pretty well established.
exception handling, recalling values, 
cross-instance thread limiter, cross-platform, etc.

10/8/2019 >> Libs v11.0.1

Nexus is still in beta.
It is working decently well in windows but is broken in Linux.
It will be updated soon.
