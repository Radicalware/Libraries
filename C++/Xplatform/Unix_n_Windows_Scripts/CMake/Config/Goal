Goal 
1. loan nano while I get $$
2. wait for market to go down
3. Buy back nano when it is cheaper
4. only give back the $$ to by back the cheaper nano while keeping the extra $$ that i was given when the nano costed more


This Happens First (Loan)
    Primary Order >> Limit Price = $11.60

This Happens Second (I buy back the nano here)
    Conditional Close >> Limit Price = $11.20




Method 1 = No Leverage
I sell out when the price gets to high to avoid losing money when the price goes down


Method 2
I borrow crypto from kraken, loan it to an investor and buy the crypto back from the investor to pay off kraken when the price goes down. I pocket the difference. That requires leverage.





-----------------------------------------------------------------------

leverage is just like you depositing a little amount of money to have access to a larger amount

So instead of you paying $11 for  a nano the broker can decide you pay $2 deposit to have access to a nano

Increasing your buying power

Increasing your risk level


So in a situation without  leverage and the  market moves against you

You might be loosing 5 cents while for a leverage account the loss can be $1 depending on the leverage amount same applies to profit


without leverage lose 5 cents
with leverage can be $1 depending on the leverage amount
