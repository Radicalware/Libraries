// QtImage v1.2.1

This object will automatically downscale/upscale images
keep their correct proportions and give you the option
to have it fill the box or perserve the full image size



All you need to do is init your class with



QtImage* _image = new QtImage(ui.push_button, "hover_off.png");
or
QtImage* _image = new QtImage(ui.push_button, "hover_off.png", "hover_on.png", Trim::full_box);

then you need to update it in the 


void MyClass::resizeEvent() {
	_image->update();
}


finally delete it

MyClass::~MyClass(){
	delete _image;
}
