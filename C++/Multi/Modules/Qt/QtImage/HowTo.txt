// QtImage v2.0.0

This object will automatically downscale/upscale images
keep their correct proportions and give you the option
to have it fill the box or perserve the full image size



QtImage* _image = new QtImageT<QLabel>(ui.banner, "folder/banner.png"); 
	1. creates an image that will downscale to fill a QLabel
	2. blank borders may be shown on the sides that are proportunatly not as long as the other sides of the box
or
QtImage* _image = new QtImageT<QPushButton>(ui.banner, "hover_off.png", "hover_on.png", Trim::full_box); 
	1. creats an image that will downscale to fill a QPushButton
	2. the image may be croped depending on the sides that are not as long as the box.
	3. The image will change with on/off overing.


then you need to update it in the 


void MyClass::resizeEvent() {
	_image->update();
}

finally delete it

MyClass::~MyClass(){
	delete _image;
}

/********************************************************************************/

Version 1.x.x 
release and some minor hotfixes were created

Version 2.0.0
Went to virtual functions to make life easier on the inheritence issues that
I was having due to the Q_OBJECT macro. It uses stylesheets instead of Pixmap.
You now have the option to add text in front of your images on both the
QLabel and QPushButton

Version 3.x.x (not yet released)
It will combine the best of both version 1/2 and will have even better ease of use
